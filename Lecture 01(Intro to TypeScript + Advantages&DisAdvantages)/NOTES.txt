What is typeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that is a super set of JavaScript by adding static types. It helps catch errors early and makes code more readable and maintainable. Itâ€™s widely used for large projects because it improves reliability and scalability.

Example:
let firstName = "Asad"
firstName = 105
firstName = true
console.log(firstName)

This code will run perfectly in JS and returns output as 'true'

But in TS:
let firstName : string = "Asad"
firstName = 105
firstName = true
console.log(firstName)

It will give error
