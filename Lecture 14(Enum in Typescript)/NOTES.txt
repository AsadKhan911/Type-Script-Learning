In TypeScript, an enum (short for "enumeration") is a special type used to define a set of named constants. It helps make code more readable and organized by giving meaningful names to numeric or string values. Just like we do in mongoose enum : ["user" , "provider"] etc.

enum Role {
  User = "user",
  Provider = "provider"
}

let myRole: Role = Role.User; // Assigning an enum value
console.log(myRole); // Output: "user"
