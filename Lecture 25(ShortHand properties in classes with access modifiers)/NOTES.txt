a TypeScript shorthand that allows you to declare and initialize class properties directly in the constructor using access modifiers (public, private, or protected). This makes your code cleaner and shorter.

What Happens Normally (Without Shorthand):

class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;

  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

In this example:

You declare properties (name, age) at the top.

Then you assign them inside the constructor using this.name = name.

Using Shorthand with Access Modifiers:

class Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
}


In this example:

The constructor parameters with access modifiers automatically:

Declare the class properties.

Assign the parameter values to those properties.

So there's no need to manually declare the properties or use this.name = name.
