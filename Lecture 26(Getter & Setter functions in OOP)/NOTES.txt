Check vs code file for better understanding.

What is a getter?
A getter is like a special door to look at the value of something inside your object.

When you want to get or see a value, you use the getter.

It acts like a function but you use it like a normal property (without parentheses).

Example:
Instead of calling person.getName(), you just write person.name and it gives you the value.

What is a setter?
A setter is a special door to change or set the value of something inside your object.

When you want to update or change a value, you use the setter.

It lets you control how the value is changed — you can check if it’s valid before saving it.

Example:
Instead of calling person.setName("Ali"), you just write person.name = "Ali" and it updates the value.

Why do we use them?
To hide the actual data inside the object (keep it private).

To control how the data is read or changed.

To add rules when updating data (like age can’t be negative).

To make code cleaner and easier to use.

Think of it like:
Your object has a safe box with your data inside (_name).

The getter is a window to look inside the safe box.

The setter is a lockable door to change what’s inside — but it only opens if the new value is good.
