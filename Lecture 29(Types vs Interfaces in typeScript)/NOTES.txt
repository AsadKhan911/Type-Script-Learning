Differences between type and interface (as used in your code):
Union Types

type supports | (union) → type Data = Student | StudentAddress

interface does not support union

Extending

type uses & → type Data = Student & StudentAddress (not shown, but possible)

interface uses extends → interface Data extends Student, StudentAddress

Merging (Same name)

interface can be declared multiple times with the same name → merges automatically

type cannot be declared twice with same name → throws error

Class implementation

interface used with implements in class

type cannot be used with implements

NOTE: Review code file for better understanding.
